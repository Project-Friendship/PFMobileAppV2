# Project Friendship Mobile App

## 🚀 How to use
### Ensure node is up to date:
The current version of node is [node: 18.18.0 LTS](https://nodejs.org/en).

In a terminal / command line prompt navigate to your source code folder.

## Get the code: (Git clone)
Copy paste / run the following command:
`git clone git@github.com:Project-Friendship/PFMobileAppV2.git`

This will create a new folder of `PFMobileAppV2`
Move your current working direction to the new folder with `cd PFMobileAppV2`

## Install the application
All the code is present but the dependencies to run the program aren't present. 
To add the required dependencies Copy paste / run the following command:
`npm install`

In the root of the folder create a new .env file.
Copy the contents of the “protected” .env file to the new .env file. If you have questions about this please email [support](mailto:it@projectfreindshipmentoring.org) for assistance.

Now that the install is complete, you can start the app with: 
`npm start`
